### 1. Video Streaming

We are still experiencing some occasional performance/quality decrease for the video streaming - which we believe is related to unsolved/unknown networking issues, only within Z43.

To experience how smooth the video streaming would normally perform, please try from "outside Z43" via home/fibre, mobile/4G/5G, etc.

One option might be to switch the streaming mode to "Jpeg", however, we'd recommend to use video streaming whenever possible (with enough bandwidth).
