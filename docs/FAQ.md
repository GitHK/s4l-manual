### What happens to running simulations when I go back to the dashboard?

The simulations will continue running and your file will be automatically saved. It is recommended to close the GUI if not needed (not to spend  credits for GUI), once you submit your simulation jobs.   

### Is it possible to automatically save my study?

- When you close a sim4life.io project by clicking "Dashboard' button, the project will be automatically. If you didn't give a name before then it will be saved as "AutoSave.smash"
- When you submit a job to run, the project will be also automatically saved. 
- In addition, you can enable/disable automatically saving option or set the saving interval on "Application" window which can be reached by clicking "Preferences" via  "Dropdown Burger Menu" and selecting "Application"
